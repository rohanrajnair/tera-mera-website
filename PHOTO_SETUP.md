# ðŸ“¸ Adding Your Restaurant Photos to the Website

## Quick Setup Guide

### Step 1: Save Your Photos
From the photos you sent in the chat, save them to your computer with these exact names:

1. **exterior-day.jpg** - Your teal exterior during the day
2. **interior-window.jpg** - Interior view through the window
3. **patio-main.jpg** - Vibrant patio with colorful umbrellas
4. **patio-bamboo.jpg** - Bamboo garden with string lights
5. **exterior-evening.jpg** - Evening exterior with golden glow
6. **patio-seating.jpg** - Outdoor seating area

### Step 2: Add Photos to Website
1. Open the `images` folder in your website directory
2. Drag and drop all 6 photos into this folder
3. Make sure the filenames match exactly (case-sensitive)

### Step 3: Test Different Hero Backgrounds
Once you add the photos, you'll see a background selector in the top-right corner of the hero section. Click the buttons to test different photos as the hero background:

- **Exterior Day** - Your teal storefront
- **Exterior Evening** - Golden hour exterior
- **Vibrant Patio** - Colorful umbrellas and garlands
- **Bamboo Garden** - Serene bamboo area

### Step 4: Choose Your Favorite
After testing, you can:
1. Remove the background selector by deleting the `.hero-selector` div from `index.html`
2. Set your preferred background by updating the CSS in `styles.css`

## Photo Recommendations

Based on your photos, here are my suggestions:

### Best Hero Background Options:
1. **exterior-day.jpg** - Shows your iconic teal storefront
2. **exterior-evening.jpg** - Warm, inviting golden hour glow
3. **patio-main.jpg** - Most vibrant and colorful option

## Troubleshooting

### If photos don't appear:
1. Check that filenames match exactly

3. Refresh the browser page
4. Check browser console for errors
